# Sales-Data-Analysis-using-PySpark
This project demonstrates how sales data can be processed and analyzed using PySpark on the Databricks platform. The objective is to understand how Databricks is used for data ingestion, transformation, and analytics using Apache Spark.

The dataset was loaded into Databricks, cleaned, structured(I have also defined schema for a case in which data is not having any definitions) and transformed using PySpark. Analytical queries were then executed to derive insights such as customer activity, sales trends, and platform-wise order distribution.

A Databricks dashboard was created to visualize the results and summarize key business insights.

Technologies Used
- Databricks (Free Edition)
